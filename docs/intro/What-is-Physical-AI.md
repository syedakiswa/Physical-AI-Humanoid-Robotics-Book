# What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that do not exist only inside software, but can **interact with the real physical world**.

These AI systems have two main parts:

- **A digital brain**  
  (AI models, LLMs, perception systems)

- **A physical body**  
  (robots, sensors, actuators)

Traditional AI lives inside screens — chatbots, apps, and websites.

But **Physical AI steps into the real world**, where the AI must understand:

- Gravity  
- Balance  
- Motion  
- Obstacles  
- Human environments  
- Real-world physics  

A Physical AI system must see, hear, move, balance, and act safely **in the same world that humans live in**.

# How Is Physical AI Different From Digital AI?

| Digital AI | Physical AI |
|-----------|--------------|
| Works on screens | Works in real environments |
| Only processes text/images | Must deal with physics and motion |
| No risk of falling or breaking | Must balance, walk, and manipulate real objects |
| No sensors | Uses LiDAR, cameras, microphones, IMUs |
| No robot body | Controls robotic limbs and motors |

Physical AI is the **next major step** in technology — AI systems that not only **think**, but also **act**.

# Why Physical AI Is Hard

To function in the real world, a robot must combine:

- **Computer vision**  
- **Motion planning**  
- **Balance control**  
- **Human interaction**  
- **Real-time decision-making**

All **at the same time**.

Because of this complexity, tools like **ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac** are essential for building advanced Physical AI systems.
