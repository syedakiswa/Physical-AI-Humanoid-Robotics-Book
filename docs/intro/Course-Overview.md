# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

This course teaches students how to build advanced AI systems that combine:

- **Perception**  
- **Language understanding**  
- **Robotic control**  
- **Simulation environments**  
- **Humanoid motion**  

Students will work with industry-standard tools used by real robotics engineers:

- **ROS 2** — Robot Operating System  
- **Gazebo** — Physics-based robot simulation  
- **Unity** — High-quality 3D visualization  
- **NVIDIA Isaac Sim** — Photorealistic training environments  
- **Whisper + GPT** — Voice and natural language control

# What Students Will Build

By the end of the course, students will be able to create a **Simulated Autonomous Humanoid Robot** capable of:

- Receiving a **voice command**  
- Using **LLMs** to generate an action plan  
- Using **ROS 2** to execute the plan  
- Navigating obstacles  
- Using **computer vision** to identify objects  
- Picking up and manipulating those objects  

This represents the **future of real-world robotics** — AI systems that can understand, plan, and act in the physical world.
