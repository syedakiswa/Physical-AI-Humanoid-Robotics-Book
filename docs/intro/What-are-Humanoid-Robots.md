# What Are Humanoid Robots?

Humanoid robots are robots designed to **look and move like humans**.

This means they usually have:

- A head  
- A torso  
- Two arms  
- Two legs  
- Hands for grasping  
- Sensors that help them **see**, **balance**, and **understand** the environment

The biggest advantage of humanoids is that they can function in **human-built environments**, such as:

- Using stairs  
- Walking through doors  
- Picking up objects  
- Interacting with furniture  
- Understanding human gestures and speech

# Why Humanoids Are Important

Human society is built for humans.  
Everything around us — chairs, tables, doors, shelves, machines — is designed for:

- Human height  
- Human hands  
- Human movement and walking style  

Because of this, a **humanoid robot can work almost anywhere a human can work**, without needing major environment changes.
