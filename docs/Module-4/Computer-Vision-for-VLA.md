# Computer Vision in VLA

Humanoids must “see” before they act.

### Vision Tasks:

- Detecting objects  
- Classifying items  
- Identifying colors, shapes, sizes  
- Understanding spatial relationships  
- Tracking moving objects  

### Sensors Used:

- RGB camera
- Depth camera
- LiDAR (optional)

### Example:

User says: “Bring me the **blue bottle** from the table.”

Vision system:

- Filters objects
- Finds only blue items
- Matches bottle shape
- Sends coordinates to the robot
