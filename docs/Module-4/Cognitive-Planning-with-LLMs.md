# Cognitive Planning with LLMs

Large Language Models (LLMs) help robots understand *complex* natural language.

### Example Command:
"Clean the room"

### LLM Converts This Into Steps:

1. Scan room
2. Identify trash or misplaced objects
3. Navigate to each object
4. Pick it up
5. Sort or place it correctly
6. Repeat until room is clean

### Why LLMs?

- Understand long and unclear instructions
- Break tasks into smaller actions
- Adapt to new environments without programming
