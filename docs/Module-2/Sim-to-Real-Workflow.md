# Sim-to-Real Workflow

Simulation is the first step before deploying to **real robots**.

### Steps:

1. Build robot model in Gazebo/Unity  
2. Test motion and AI algorithms  
3. Simulate sensors and tasks  
4. Train AI models (navigation, grasping, vision)  
5. Transfer trained model/code to real robot  

> Benefit: Reduces risk, saves cost, and ensures smoother real-world deployment.
