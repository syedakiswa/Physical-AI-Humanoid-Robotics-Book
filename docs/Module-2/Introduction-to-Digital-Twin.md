# Introduction to the Digital Twin

A **Digital Twin** is a **virtual replica of a real robot or environment**.  
It allows engineers and students to **simulate, test, and train robots safely** before using real hardware.

### Why Digital Twins?

- Test robot behavior without risk  
- Experiment with different robot designs  
- Train AI algorithms in a safe environment  
- Generate large datasets for machine learning  

### Tools Used

- **Gazebo**: Simulates physics and sensors  
- **Unity**: High-quality visualization and human-robot interaction  
- **ROS 2**: Connects control code to the simulated robot
