# Why TF2 Is Important

**TF2** solves three major problems in robotics:

---

## 1. Robots Move Constantly

Robots walk, turn, tilt cameras, lift arms — everything moves.  
**TF2 keeps all body parts aligned correctly** even while the robot is moving.

---

## 2. Sensors See the World Differently

A **camera**, **LiDAR**, and **IMU** all perceive objects from different positions.  
**TF2 merges their views** into a single, shared understanding of the environment.

---

## 3. Robots Must Think in 3D

Robots need to know their position and orientation in **three dimensions**:

- Forward / Backward  
- Left / Right  
- Up / Down  
- Roll / Pitch / Yaw  

**TF2 maintains this information** as a continually updated tree of coordinate frames.
