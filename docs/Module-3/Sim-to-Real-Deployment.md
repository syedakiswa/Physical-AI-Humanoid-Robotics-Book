# Sim-to-Real Deployment

After training in Isaac Sim, **deploy AI models to real robots**.

### Steps:

1. Train in simulation (Isaac Sim + RL + Nav2)  
2. Test AI algorithms using Isaac ROS  
3. Transfer trained model to Jetson or robot hardware  
4. Fine-tune with real sensor data  

> Advantage: Reduces risk, saves time, and ensures smoother real-world deployment.
