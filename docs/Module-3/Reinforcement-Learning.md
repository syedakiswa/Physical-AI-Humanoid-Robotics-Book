# Reinforcement Learning for Humanoids

Reinforcement Learning (RL) helps robots **learn complex tasks** by trial and error.

### Workflow:

1. Define task (e.g., walking, picking objects)  
2. Set rewards and penalties  
3. Train AI in Isaac Sim  
4. Evaluate performance and refine models

> Benefit: Robot learns naturally without explicit programming for every scenario.
