Humanoid robots need to **perceive the world accurately**.

### Techniques:

- Depth camera for 3D environment perception  
- LiDAR for mapping and collision detection  
- Object detection using AI models  
- Sensor fusion: Combining IMU, LiDAR, and camera data  

### Goal:

Enable the robot to **understand its surroundings** and interact safely and intelligently.
